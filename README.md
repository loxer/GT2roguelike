## Story

You play as a old phone who has just been trown out for a brand new jphone who is way better looking, smarter and hasn't had it's battery programmed to die for no reason. So what do you do just turn to dust or play electro dungeon and break that jphones into a million pieces. 

## Play 
- to play Electro Dungeon on Windows, get it from our [releases page](https://github.com/daaning/GT2roguelike/releases)
- use WSAD or arrow keys to walk around in the dungeon 
- point and shoot at enemies with your right mouse button
- charge by going over outlets
- Behold! You are losing battery every second!

### Charge That Phone!
Juice that old battery back up and keep fighting those annoying pop ups and applications, defying death for just a bit longer :)

### Dugeon Generator:
To show off the random dungeon generation, the camera follows the generation of the path from start to finish. Hope you can figure out where to charge and how to conserve energy before it's too late and the enemies win again.

### Applicalicious NomNomNom
These apps are getting hungerier by the day, run fast before applicalicious installs some updates and absolutely destroys your battery.

### iPhonius Maximus:
Next to our "regular" enemies we have an gruesome boss battle against the great iPhonius Maximus who is your replacement. Aggrivated as you are, you should at the very least break its screen or empty its battery before yours runs out.
