## Cool features 

### iphonius maximus:
Next to our "regular" enemies we have an gruesome boss battle against the great iphonius maximus who is your replacement and you should at the very least break his screen or something.


### dugeon Outlook:
To show off the dungeon we have just randomly generated for you we have build a camera module that's shows the generatation of the path towards the end and the rest of the dungeon. Hope you can figure out where to charge and how to conserve energie before it's too late

### charge that phone!
Juice that old battery back up and keep fighting those annoying pop ups and applications, defing death for just a bit longer :)
