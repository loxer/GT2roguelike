### dugeon generator:
To show off the dungeon the creator has just randomly generated for you we have build a camera module that's shows the generatation of the path towards the end and the rest of the dungeon. Hope you can figure out where to charge and how to conserve energy before it's too late and the pop ups win again.


### Appalicious NomNomNOm
These apps are getting hungerier by the day, run fast before appalicious installs some updates and absolutely destroy your battery

### iphonius maximus:
Next to our "regular" enemies we have an gruesome boss battle against the great iphonius maximus who is your replacement and you should at the very least break it's screen or empty it's battery before yours runs out.
